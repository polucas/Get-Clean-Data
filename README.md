# Getting and Cleaning Data assignment
This repo contains files I created for the assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data course from Coursera.

The data set created in this assaignment is in the file 'tidy_set.txt' and contains data from the following source:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The Readme file from the above mentioned data set contains description of what it represents and how the data was obtained. 

Here I have created a 'tidy' data set following points 1-6, which correspond to the steps described in 'run_analysis.R':
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity labels to name the activities in the data set
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
