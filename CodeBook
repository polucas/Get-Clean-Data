# Code Book

By J. Malec

This code book summarizes the variables in `tidy_set.txt`, which contains space-separated values. The first row contains 
names of variables.

## Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subjects that performed the activities; integer variable with range 1: 30;
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken; further detailed below 
* 			   in 'Activity Labels' sections; string variable with 6 values;

## Activity Labels

* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking on a flat surface
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase 
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase 
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting 
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing 
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down 

## Variables

Data has been compiled from Gyroscopes and Accelerometers installed in the phones that the subjects wore to create
the measurements. Those were classified in 2 signal domains: Time and Frequency. All the signals were decomposed into their 
components along 3 axis: X, Y and Z. The data from the instruments is expressed as gravity acceleration (for gravity's 
component) or body accelaration (for body's component). 

All measurements are floating-point values, normalized and bound within [-1, 1]. 

All variables from the created 'tidy' data set are listed below. The names were modified to be more clear 
(i.e. abbreviations converted into longer, more descriptive names). The variables provided in the 'tidy_set.txt' data set 
correspond only to average values for each measurement (-mean) and their standard deviation (-std), while the original data set 
provided each component for each dimension. The general scheme for nomenclature of the variables is: 
{TimeOrFrequency}{Measurement}{MeanOrStd}{X/Y/Z}
